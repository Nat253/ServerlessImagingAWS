Devito is a new tool for performing
optimised Finite Difference (FD) computation from high-level
symbolic problem definitions. Devito performs automated code
generation and Just-In-time (JIT) compilation based on symbolic
equations defined in SymPy to create and execute highly
optimised Finite Difference kernels on multiple computer
platforms.
